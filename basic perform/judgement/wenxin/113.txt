Review of Answer to Question 1:
The assistant's answer to the first question contains a mathematical error. The correct approach to finding the probability that a student likes neither blue nor green is to subtract the sum of the individual probabilities for liking blue and green from 100% and then add back the probability for liking both colors to avoid double-counting. The assistant incorrectly subtracted the probability of liking both colors from the sum of the individual probabilities. The correct calculation should be:

100% - (58% + 45% - 22%) = 100% - (103% - 22%) = 100% - 81% = 19%

Therefore, the correct probability that a randomly selected student at the school likes neither blue nor green is 19%, as indicated in the reference answer.

Review of Answer to Question 2:
The assistant's answer to the second question is incorrect. The question asks for the probability that a student who likes green would dislike both blue and green. Since the student already likes green, the probability that they dislike both colors is 0%. The assistant's answer of 55% is incorrect and seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the question.
