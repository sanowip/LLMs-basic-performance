Evaluation of the first question:

The assistant's answer to the first question is correct but not as concise as the reference answer. The assistant provides additional context about the White House being the official residence of the President of the United States and its location in Washington, D.C. The reference answer simply states the location as "Washington, DC". The assistant's answer is helpful in that it gives more information, which may be useful for someone who is not familiar with the White House.

Rating for the first question: [[8]]

Evaluation of the second question:

The assistant's answer to the second question is in line with the reference answer. Both acknowledge that the original question does not contain any specific clues that would allow someone to determine the location of the White House. The assistant's response elaborates on why the information given is insufficient, mentioning the lack of precise geographical coordinates or a detailed address, which is not necessary but adds to the clarity of the explanation.
