The assistant's answer to the first question is correct and matches the reference answer. The calculation is accurately performed, and the explanation is clear and helpful. It correctly finds that f(2) equals 0 by substituting x with 2 and simplifying the expression.

The assistant's answer to the second question, however, is incorrect and does not match the reference answer. The assistant claims that the solutions to the equation f(x) = 0 are x = -1 or x = 4, but this is not supported by the information given. In fact, from the first question, we know that f(2) = 0, which means that x = 2 is a solution. The assistant's response does not provide a valid method for finding the solutions and incorrectly states the values of x that satisfy the equation f(x) = 0.
