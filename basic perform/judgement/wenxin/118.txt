Review of Answer 1:

The assistant's answer is incorrect. The initial approach to the problem is reasonable; however, the explanation becomes unclear and contains errors. The assistant incorrectly posits that the expression (2n + 8) becomes an odd number after subtracting n, which is not relevant to finding the remainder when the expression is divided by 4. The assistant concludes that the remainder is 4, which is not supported by the correct arithmetic or logic.

The correct approach, as shown in the reference answer, is to express the original number as 10x + 4 (where x is an integer), then double it to get 20x + 8. This expression can be divided by 4 to yield a remainder of 0 since 20x + 8 is a multiple of 4. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.

Review of Answer 2:

The assistant's answer is partially correct but contains a critical error. The assistant correctly identifies that when the number is doubled, it becomes 2n + 8. However, the explanation that follows is incorrect. The assistant introduces an irrelevant case analysis about n being 0 or greater than 0, which does not contribute to determining the remainder when the number is divided by 5.

The correct approach, as shown in the reference answer, is to take the doubled number 20x + 8 and divide it by 5. This yields 5 * (4x + 1) + 3, which clearly shows that the remainder is 3, regardless of the value of x.

Therefore, the correct answer is 3, which the assistant eventually states, but the path to the answer is flawed and the reasoning is incorrect.
