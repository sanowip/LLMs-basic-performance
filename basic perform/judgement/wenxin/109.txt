[question1]:
The assistant's answer to the first question is incorrect. The correct answer is that the shadow of the pole would point west, not east. Since the sun rises in the east, the shadow would fall on the opposite side, which is west. The assistant's explanation mistakenly states that the shadow points towards the sun and concludes the shadow points east. The correct reasoning is that if Suresh is facing a pole and the shadow falls to his right, and since the sun is in the east at sunrise, Suresh must be facing north for the shadow to fall to his right, which means the shadow is pointing west.

[question2]:
The assistant's answer to the second question is incorrect. The correct answer is that Suresh was facing south. The reasoning should be that since the sun rises in the east, for the shadow to fall to Suresh's right, he must be facing south. The assistant's explanation incorrectly states that Suresh was facing east and uses incorrect logic regarding the Earth's rotation and the position of the sun relative to Suresh and the pole. The correct reasoning is that the sun is to the east during sunrise, and if the shadow is to the right of Suresh, he must be facing south for the shadow to fall in that direction.
