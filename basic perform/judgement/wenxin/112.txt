Review of Answer to Question 1:
The assistant's answer contains a calculation error. The correct total investment over two years is $12,000, not $16,000 as stated by the assistant. The startup invested $8,000 in the first year and half of that amount, which is $4,000, in the second year. The sum of these investments is $8,000 + $4,000, which equals $12,000. The error seems to be a result of adding an extra $4,000 in the final tally.

Review of Answer to Question 2:
The assistant's answer to the second question is incorrect. The correct amount to be invested in the third year is $2,000, which is half of the $4,000 invested in the second year. The assistant incorrectly states that the startup will invest $4,000 in the third year and goes on to incorrectly calculate the total investment over three years as $20,000. The correct total investment over three years should be $8,000 (first year) + $4,000 (second year) + $2,000 (third year) = $14,000.
