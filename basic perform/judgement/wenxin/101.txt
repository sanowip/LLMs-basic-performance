The assistant's answer to the first question is correct. If you overtake the second person in a race, you move into second place, and the person you overtook moves into third place. This matches the reference answer, which succinctly states "You are in second place."

Rating for question 1: [[10]]

The assistant's answer to the second question is incorrect. Overtaking the last person in a race is not possible because there is no one behind the last person to overtake them. Therefore, if you are behind the last person, you are already in last place, and overtaking them is not an option. The reference answer indicates uncertainty, which is a more appropriate response than the incorrect scenario provided by the assistant.
