Evaluation for [answer1]:

The assistant's answer to the first question does not address the user's requirement correctly. The user asked for a solution that does not use any extra data structures, but the assistantâ€™s solution uses a `set`, which is an extra data structure. The reference answer provides an approach that meets the user's constraint by using a nested loop to compare elements, which has a time complexity of O(n^2). The assistant's answer, while more efficient, does not adhere to the constraints of the problem.

Evaluation for [answer2]:

The assistant's answer to the second question is correct and helpful. The solution provided by the assistant uses sets to find the common elements between two arrays, which is an optimal approach when the constraint of not using extra data structures has been removed. Both the assistant's answer and the reference answer suggest using sets to achieve O(n) time complexity, and the assistant correctly explains the process and the efficiency of the method. The assistant's use of the intersection operator `&` and the reference's use of the `intersection` method are functionally equivalent, so there is no mistake in the assistant's answer.
