[question1]:
The assistant's answer to the first question is incorrect. The reference answer correctly identifies that David does not have any brothers; he is the one brother to his three sisters. The assistant's answer incorrectly states that David has three brothers, which is a fundamental misunderstanding of the question. The question implies that David is the one brother that each of his sisters has.

[question2]:
The assistant's answer to the second question is also incorrect. If each of David's sisters has two brothers, this includes David and one additional brother. Therefore, David would have one brother, not six. The assistant's response incorrectly multiplies the number of sisters by the number of brothers each sister has, which does not account for the fact that siblings are shared among each other. The reference answer correctly identifies that David has one brother.
