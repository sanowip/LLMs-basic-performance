Review for [answer1]:
The assistant's answer provides a correct C++ program to find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. The code is well-structured, and the explanation is clear and accurate. The function `fibonacci` implements the base case correctly for `n <= 1` and the recursive case for `n > 1`. The `main` function correctly handles user input and displays the result. The assistant's answer matches the reference answer in terms of functionality and correctness.

Review for [answer2]:
The assistant's answer provides a Python program that attempts to find the nth number in a sequence where each number is the sum of the three preceding ones, with the first three numbers being 0, -1, -1. However, the implementation has a logical error. The reference answer indicates that for `n < 3`, the initial cases should be handled carefully, but the assistant's program does not account for this and starts iterating from the fourth number without considering `n` might be less than 4. Furthermore, the assistant's program does not correctly update the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the loop. The correct update sequence should be `next_number = a + b + c`, then `a = b`, `b = c`, and `c = next_number`.

To fix the assistant's code, it should first check if `n < 3` and return the corresponding number from the initial sequence. Then, if `n >= 3`, it should proceed with the iteration while correctly updating the last three numbers.
