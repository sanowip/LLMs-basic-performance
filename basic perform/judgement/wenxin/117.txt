Evaluation of Answer 1:
The assistant's answer states that the solution to the inequality |x + 5| < 10 is -10 < x + 5 < 10 and lists the integers -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as the solution, concluding that there are 9 integers. However, the reference answer indicates that there are actually 19 integers in the solution, ranging from -14 to 4. The assistant's answer incorrectly excludes 0 and includes 1 twice while omitting the integers from -14 to -6 and 0. The correct solution is -15 < x < 5, which includes the integers -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, totaling 19 integers.

Evaluation of Answer 2:
The assistant's answer states that the solution to the inequality |x + 10| < 5 is -5 < x + 10 < 5 and lists the integers -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, 9, 10, 11, and 12 as the solution, concluding that there are 9 integers. However, this is incorrect. The correct solution to the inequality is -15 < x < -5, which includes the integers -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, and -6, totaling 9 integers. The assistant's answer incorrectly includes the integers 9, 10, 11, and 12, which do not satisfy the inequality.
