The assistant's answer to the first question is incorrect. The correct calculation should be done by subtracting the sum of the individual probabilities of liking blue and green from 100%, and then adding back the probability of liking both colors since it was counted twice. The correct calculation is:

100% - (58% + 45% - 22%) = 100% - 81% = 19%

So the probability that a student likes neither blue nor green is 19%. The assistant incorrectly subtracted the overlap from the total, resulting in an incorrect probability of 29%.

The assistant's answer to the second question is also incorrect. If a student likes green, the probability that they dislike both colors is 0% because it is given that they like at least one color (green). The assistant's approach to solving the problem is fundamentally flawed because it misinterprets the conditions given in the question. The calculations involving conditional probabilities and assumptions about fractions of students who dislike both colors are unnecessary and incorrect in this context.
