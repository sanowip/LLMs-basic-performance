Evaluation of Answer to Question 1:
The assistant's answer to the first question is correct. The assistant provided a step-by-step calculation of f(2) for the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 9x - 14, which resulted in the correct answer of 0. This matches the reference answer provided.

Rating for Question 1: [[10]]

Evaluation of Answer to Question 2:
The assistant's answer to the second question is incorrect. The assistant provided a method to solve the equation using software like Mathematica, and the output given suggests three approximate real roots. However, the reference answer indicates that the correct value of x that makes f(x) = 0 is x = 2. This discrepancy suggests that the assistant's answer is not correct. The assistant should have verified the solution by substituting x = 2 into the function to confirm that it results in f(x) = 0, which it does.
