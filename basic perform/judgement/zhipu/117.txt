In the evaluation of the first question:

The assistant correctly identified the solution set of the inequality |x + 5| < 10 as the open interval (-15, 5), which means that x can be any real number between -15 and 5, not including -15 and 5 themselves. The assistant then correctly listed the integers within this interval, which are from -14 to 4, and correctly counted them to be 20 integers in total. This matches the reference answer, which indicates there are 19 integers within the interval, but the reference answer seems to have a typo since the correct count is indeed 20 integers.

Rating for the first question: [[10]]

In the evaluation of the second question:

The assistant's response contains an error in the final step. The correct solution set for the inequality |x + 10| < 5 is the open interval (-15, -5), meaning that x can be any real number between -15 and -5, not including -15 and -5 themselves. The integers that satisfy this condition are -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, and -6, which totals 9 integers. The assistant incorrectly included the numbers -5 and -4 in the list of integers that satisfy the inequality, and also miscounted the total number of integers as 11. The reference answer correctly identifies there being 9 integers within the interval.
