Evaluating the assistant's answer to the first question:
The assistant's answer is correct. If oranges cost more than apples (statement 1) and oranges cost less than bananas (statement 2), then it follows that bananas cost more than both apples and oranges (statement 3). Therefore, the third statement is true, given that the first two statements are true. The assistant's explanation is logical and aligns with the reference answer.

Evaluating the assistant's answer to the second question:
The assistant's answer is incorrect. The correct answer is that the truth value of the first statement is uncertain if only the third statement is given as true. The third statement only tells us that bananas cost more than oranges and more than apples. It does not provide any direct information about the relative costs of oranges and apples. It is possible that oranges cost more, less, or the same as apples based on the information given in the third statement alone. The assistant incorrectly deduced that the first statement must be false, which is not a logically necessary conclusion from the third statement alone.
