Review of Answer 1:
The assistant's answer to the first question is incorrect. The provided code does not correctly implement the calculation of the number of full binary trees with n vertices (B_n). The assistant's approach assumes that B_n can be calculated by multiplying the number of full binary trees with n-1 vertices by the number of full binary trees with n-2 vertices, which is not correct. The correct approach involves dynamic programming and takes into account that a full binary tree with n vertices must have an odd number of vertices. Additionally, the number of full binary trees is related to the Catalan numbers, which are not mentioned in the assistant's answer. The correct implementation should check if n is even (in which case B_n is 0) and should use dynamic programming to compute the number of full binary trees for odd values of n.

Review of Answer 2:
The assistant's answer to the second question is also incorrect. The provided code for calculating the number of full ternary trees with n vertices (T_n) is based on a flawed recursive approach that does not take into account the correct structure of ternary trees. Ternary trees, where each vertex has zero or three children, have a different recursive structure than binary trees. The assistant's function incorrectly attempts to use the same approach as for binary trees, which does not apply to ternary trees. The correct approach should involve dynamic programming and take into account that for ternary trees, the number of vertices n must be of the form 3k + 1 to have a full ternary tree. The reference answer provides the correct dynamic programming solution that correctly computes the number of full ternary trees by considering all possible combinations of the number of vertices in the three subtrees.
