The assistant's answer to the first question is incorrect. The correct answer is that David has no brothers; he is the one brother of his three sisters. The assistant incorrectly stated that David has one brother. The reference answer is correct.

The assistant's answer to the second question is also incorrect. The correct answer is that David has one brother. The assistant's answer incorrectly assumes that the brothers are not shared among the sisters and mistakenly calculates that David would have seven brothers. However, regardless of the number of brothers each sister has, they all share the same brothers. Therefore, if each sister has two brothers, one of those brothers is David, and the other would be the same second brother for all three sisters.
