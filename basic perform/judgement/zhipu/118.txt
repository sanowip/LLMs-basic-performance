Evaluation of Answer 1:
The assistant's answer to the first question is incorrect. The assistant's method of solving the problem is flawed, as it incorrectly assumes that the remainder when 2x is divided by 4 is 32, which is not possible since the remainder must be less than the divisor. The correct remainder should be 0, as shown in the reference answer, because 20x + 8 can be divided by 4 without any remainder.

Evaluation of Answer 2:
The assistant's answer to the second question is also incorrect. The assistant made a mistake by substituting x with 5 * (q1 - 4/5), which does not align with the given condition that x divided by 10 gives a remainder of 4. The correct substitution would be x = 10 * q1 + 4. Furthermore, the assistant incorrectly concludes that the remainder when 2x is divided by 5 is 8, which contradicts the reference answer that correctly states the remainder is 3. The correct calculation should show that 20x + 8 gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 5.
