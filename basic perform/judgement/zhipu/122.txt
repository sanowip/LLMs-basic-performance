Evaluation of Answer 1:
The assistant's answer for the first question is correct and matches the reference answer. The provided C++ program correctly implements a recursive function to find the nth Fibonacci number. The base cases for n being 0 or 1 are correctly handled, and the recursive case correctly sums the two preceding Fibonacci numbers. The program also includes a main function that prompts the user for input and displays the result.

Evaluation of Answer 2:
The assistant's answer for the second question contains errors. The base cases are not correctly defined for the sequence specified in the question. The sequence should start with 0, -1, -1, but the assistant's implementation does not correctly handle the initial cases when n is less than 3. Moreover, the recursive formula provided by the assistant is incorrect as it unnecessarily adds terms sequence(n-4), sequence(n-5), and sequence(n-6) which are not part of the problem statement. The correct implementation should only sum the last three terms of the sequence. Therefore, the assistant's answer does not align with the reference answer which correctly uses a loop and a vector to calculate the nth number in the sequence.
