Evaluation for [question1]:

The assistant's answer to the first question is incorrect. The assistant attempts to find individual values for x and y, which is an unnecessary and incorrect approach for this problem. The reference answer correctly demonstrates that (x - y)^2 = (x + y)^2 - 4xy, which simplifies to 0 since the given equations are x + y = 4z and x * y = 4z^2. Therefore, (x - y)^2 = 0, which means x - y = 0. The assistant's answer is not only incorrect but also fails to provide the simple and direct solution that the reference answer provides.

Evaluation for [question2]:

The assistant's answer to the second question is also incorrect. The assistant incorrectly attempts to express z - x in terms of y by manipulating the given equations and ends up with the expression (y - 3x) / 4. The reference answer provides the correct solution by observing that z - x is equivalent to z - 2z (since x + y = 4z, then x = 4z - y, and substituting into z - x gives z - (4z - y) = -3z + y, which simplifies to -z = (-1/2)y). Therefore, the correct expression for z - x in terms of y is (-1/2)y. The assistant's answer does not arrive at this correct solution and is not helpful.
