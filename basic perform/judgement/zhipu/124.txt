Review of the Assistant's Answer to Question 1:
The assistant's response to the first question suggests that the original function is correct and provides an alternative implementation using a one-dimensional array to optimize memory usage. However, the suggested optimized version contains logical errors and does not correctly implement the longest common subsequence algorithm. The use of `dp[i + j - 1]` is incorrect and does not align with the two-dimensional nature of the problem, which requires keeping track of the states of subproblems based on two indices. The reference answer correctly states that there is no bug in the original implementation.

Review of the Assistant's Answer to Question 2:
The assistant's response to the second question states that the function is correct, but this is inaccurate. The assistant overlooks the bug in the initialization of the `dp` array, where `None` is used instead of `0`. This would result in a `TypeError` when attempting to execute arithmetic operations with `None`. The reference answer correctly identifies this bug. The assistant's explanation of the algorithm is otherwise correct, but the failure to identify the bug in the code significantly affects the usefulness of the response.
