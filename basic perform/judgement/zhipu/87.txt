Evaluation for [answer2]:
The response to the second question adheres to the constraint of using four-word sentences throughout the answer. The narrative is concise and maintains the essence of the original story. However, it is worth noting that while the response is creative and adheres to the rules set by the prompt, the brevity required by four-word sentences limits the depth and detail that can be conveyed. This constraint naturally reduces the complexity and richness of the story compared to the first response. Despite this, the assistant effectively communicates the main points of the story, preserving its core elements within the strict sentence structure limitation. There are no errors in the response.
