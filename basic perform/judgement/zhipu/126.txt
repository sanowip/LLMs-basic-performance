Review of Answer 1:
The assistant's answer to question 1 describes an algorithm to find the median of two sorted arrays with O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity. The provided code indeed uses binary search to find the correct partition between the arrays and calculates the median, which is consistent with the well-known optimal solution for this problem. The solution assumes that the arrays are sorted and the code is designed to work with arrays of different sizes.

However, the reference answer suggests that the given solution may not be linear complexity (O(n)), as the question requested. The reference answer provides a different approach that iterates through both arrays simultaneously, merging them until the median is found, which is guaranteed to have a linear time complexity. The assistant's answer does not address the time complexity issue directly in the explanation, but the provided code is generally known to have a time complexity of O(log(min(n, m))), not O(n).

Given that the question explicitly asks for a function with O(n) time complexity, the assistant's answer does not meet this requirement. Therefore, the response is incorrect as per the question's constraints.

Review of Answer 2:
The assistant's answer to question 2 correctly states that there exists an implementation with better time complexity than O(n), specifically O(log(min(n, m))). The provided code in the answer is the same as in answer 1, which is indeed an implementation with a time complexity of O(log(min(n, m))). The assistant correctly identifies that the binary search approach used in the code is more efficient than the linear approach when dealing with sorted arrays.

The reference answer for question 2 provides a similar binary search solution, which is consistent with the assistant's explanation and code. Both the assistant's answer and the reference answer demonstrate the use of a binary search algorithm to achieve the improved time complexity.

Therefore, the assistant's response to question 2 is correct and helpful, as it provides an accurate explanation and an appropriate code example for an implementation with better time complexity.
