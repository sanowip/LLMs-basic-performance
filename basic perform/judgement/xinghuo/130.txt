Evaluation for [answer1]:

The assistant's solution for the first question is incorrect. The provided code is for finding common elements in two sorted arrays using the two-pointer technique. However, the question does not state that the arrays are sorted, and the assistant's solution assumes they are, which is not in line with the question's requirements. Additionally, the assistant's answer does not address the constraint of not using any extra data structures; the solution uses a list to store common elements. The reference answer provides a correct O(n^2) solution that iterates through both arrays and checks for common elements without assuming the arrays are sorted and without using extra data structures other than the list for the result, which is allowed as per the question's phrasing.

Evaluation for [answer2]:

The assistant's answer for the second question correctly removes the constraint of not using extra data structures and provides a solution with better time complexity than the first answer. The solution sorts both arrays and then uses the two-pointer technique to find common elements, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting. However, the reference answer suggests an even more optimal solution with O(n) time complexity by using a hash table (set or dict) to store the elements of one array and then finding the intersection with the second array. While the assistant's answer is a valid and correct solution, it is not the most optimal one given the removal of constraints.
