Regarding the first question, the assistant's answer states that the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4 is 8. However, this is incorrect since the remainder must be less than the divisor. The correct remainder should be 0 because 8 is divisible by 4. The reference answer correctly identifies that twice the number, when divided by 4, yields a remainder of 0.

For the second question, the assistant's answer correctly identifies that when twice the number (which is 10k + 4) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. This is because when 8 (twice the original remainder of 4) is divided by 5, it leaves a remainder of 3. The reference answer confirms this calculation with an algebraic expression showing that 20x + 8 yields a remainder of 3 when divided by 5.
