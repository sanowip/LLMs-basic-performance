Review of Answer 1:
The assistant's answer is correct. Since the sun rises in the east and the shadow falls to the right of Suresh, it means the shadow is pointing west. The assistant's reasoning is sound and aligns with the reference answer.

Review of Answer 2:
The assistant's answer is incorrect. Given that the shadow of the pole falls to the right of Suresh, and the sun rises in the east, Suresh must be facing towards the south for the shadow to be on his right side. The assistant incorrectly states that Suresh was facing east, which would result in the shadow falling behind him, not to his right. The correct direction Suresh was facing should be south, as per the reference answer.
