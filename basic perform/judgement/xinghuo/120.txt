Question 2 Evaluation:
The assistant's answer to the second question is incorrect. The assistant incorrectly attempted to factor the equation by separating it into two expressions and equating them, which is not a valid algebraic manipulation. The correct approach to solve the equation f(x) = 0 would involve finding the roots of the cubic equation 4x^3 - 9x - 14 = 0, which is not done in the assistant's answer. The assistant's method does not lead to a valid solution for the given equation. Additionally, there is a conceptual mistake in stating that "f(2) = g(2)h(2) = 0," as this does not follow from any correct algebraic principle.
