Review of Answer to Question 1:
The assistant's response to the first question is incorrect. The provided solution involves an unnecessary step of taking the square root, which is not applicable to the given equations. The error occurs at the step where the assistant takes the square root of both sides, which introduces extraneous solutions. The reference answer correctly uses algebraic manipulation to find that (x-y)^2 equals zero, leading to the conclusion that x-y is zero. Thus, the correct answer is x-y=0.

Review of Answer to Question 2:
The assistant's answer to the second question is incorrect. The assistant simply states z - x = y, which is an assumption without any justification or derivation from the given equations. The reference answer correctly identifies that z - x can be expressed in terms of y by using the initial equations to find the relationship between z and y, leading to the conclusion that z - x = (-1/2)y.
