The assistant's answer to the first question is correct. If oranges cost more than apples (statement 1) and oranges cost less than bananas (statement 2), it logically follows that bananas cost more than both apples and oranges, making the third statement true. Therefore, the assistant's response aligns with the reference answer.

Rating for the first question: [[10]]

For the second question, the assistant's answer is incorrect. The third statement being true only establishes that bananas are the most expensive among the three. It does not provide any information about the relative costs of oranges and apples. Since we don't have information on the direct comparison between apples and oranges from the third statement alone, the truth value of the first statement (oranges cost more than apples) remains uncertain. The assistant's response does not align with the reference answer, which correctly identifies the first statement as uncertain based on the information provided by the third statement.
