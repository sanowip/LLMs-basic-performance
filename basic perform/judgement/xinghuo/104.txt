Evaluation of Answer 1:
The assistant's answer incorrectly states that David has 4 brothers. The reference answer correctly points out that David has no brothers; he is the one brother to his three sisters. The assistant's answer misunderstood the scenario by adding David as an additional brother to the count, which is incorrect because David is the brother being referred to in the question.

Evaluation of Answer 2:
The assistant's answer to the second question is incorrect. It mistakenly multiplies the number of sisters by the number of brothers each sister has, which results in an answer of 6 brothers. However, the correct interpretation should consider that David is one of the two brothers each sister has. Since David is one of the brothers, and the question implies that each sister has the same two brothers, the correct answer is that David has one brother. The reference answer is correct.
