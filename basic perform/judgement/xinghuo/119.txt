Review of Assistant's Answer to Question 1:
The assistant's answer correctly calculates the individual costs of the sci-fi novels, history books, and philosophy books, and then correctly sums these amounts to get the total cost of Benjamin's purchases, which is $280. This matches the reference answer and is correct.

Review of Assistant's Answer to Question 2:
The assistant's answer to the second question contains several mistakes. The assistant correctly identifies the markup calculation for the sci-fi novels but incorrectly applies it to the total cost of the sci-fi novels ($100) rather than the price per book ($20). The correct calculation for the selling price per sci-fi novel should be $20 x 1.25 = $25, and thus the total revenue from the sci-fi novels should be $25 x 5 = $125. However, the assistant fails to calculate the markup for the history and philosophy books.

The correct calculations for the markup prices are:
- History books: $30 x 1.25 = $37.50 each, so $37.50 x 3 = $112.50 in total.
- Philosophy books: $45 x 1.25 = $56.25 each, so $56.25 x 2 = $112.50 in total.

The correct total revenue should be $125 (sci-fi novels) + $112.50 (history books) + $112.50 (philosophy books) = $350.

The assistant's answer incorrectly states the revenue from the history and philosophy books as $90 each, which is the original cost without markup, and incorrectly sums the total revenue as $305. The correct total revenue should be $350.
