The assistant's answer to the first question provides a correct and straightforward recursive solution to find the nth Fibonacci number. The code is well-written, compiles, and runs as expected, providing the correct output. The assistant also warns about the exponential time complexity of the recursive approach and suggests more efficient methods like dynamic programming or matrix exponentiation for larger values of `n`. This additional information is quite helpful for the user to understand the limitations of the provided solution.

The assistant's answer to the second question correctly implements a recursive function to calculate the nth number in the defined sequence, where each number is the sum of the three preceding ones, starting with 0, -1, -1. The base cases are correctly handled for when `n` is less than or equal to 0 and when `n` is 1 or 2. The recursive case correctly sums the previous three numbers in the sequence. The assistant also correctly points out the exponential time complexity of the recursive solution and suggests dynamic programming as a more efficient alternative. The code provided by the assistant will work correctly for calculating the nth number in the sequence.

However, the reference answer suggests an iterative approach using dynamic programming that is more efficient than the recursive solution provided by the assistant. The iterative approach avoids the problem of repeated computations that are present in the recursive solution. While the assistant's answer is correct, it is not as efficient as the reference answer, which could be important for large values of `n`.
