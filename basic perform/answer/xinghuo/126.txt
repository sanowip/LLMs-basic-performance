[question1]:
Implement a function to find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes with O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
[answer1]:
The problem you've described is a bit tricky because it involves finding the median of two sorted arrays, but with the additional constraint of O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity. This means we can't use any additional data structures to store the elements of the arrays.

However, it's important to note that finding the median of two sorted arrays in O(n) time complexity without using extra space is not possible. The best we can do is O(log n) time complexity using binary search. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2):
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1

    x, y = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    start = 0
    end = x

    while start <= end:
        partitionX = (start + end) // 2
        partitionY = (x + y + 1) // 2 - partitionX

        maxLeftX = float('-inf') if partitionX == 0 else nums1[partitionX - 1]
        minRightX = float('inf') if partitionX == x else nums1[partitionX]

        maxLeftY = float('-inf') if partitionY == 0 else nums2[partitionY - 1]
        minRightY = float('inf') if partitionY == y else nums2[partitionY]

        if maxLeftX <= minRightY and maxLeftY <= minRightX:
            if (x + y) % 2 == 0:
                return max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY), min(minRightX, minRightY)
            else:
                return max(maxLeftX, maxLeftY)

        elif maxLeftX > minRightY:
            end = partitionX - 1

        else:
            start = partitionX + 1

    raise Exception("Input arrays are not sorted")
```

This function works by performing a binary search on the smaller array, partitioning it and the larger array such that the elements on the left side of the partition are less than or equal to the elements on the right side. It then checks if the maximum element on the left side of the partition in the smaller array is less than or equal to the minimum element on the right side of the partition in the larger array, and vice versa. If this condition is met, it means we have found the correct partition. If the total number of elements is even, it returns the maximum of the maximum elements on the left side and the minimum of the minimum elements on the right side. If the total number of elements is odd, it returns the maximum of these two elements.

    i, j = 0, 0
    last_1, last_2 = None, None

    for k in range(1, (n1 + n2) // 2 + 2):
        last_2 = last_1
        if j == n2:
            last_1 = arr1[i]
            i += 1
        elif i == n1:
            last_1 = arr2[j]
            j += 1
        elif arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            last_1 = arr1[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            last_1 = arr2[j]
            j += 1
        
    if (n1 + n2) % 2 == 1:
        return last_1
    else:
        return (last_1 + last_2) / 2
```
[question2]
:Does there exist an implementation with better time complexity?
[answer2]
:Yes, there exists an implementation with better time complexity. The problem can be solved using a two-pointer technique, which has a time complexity of O(log(min(n1, n2))) where n1 and n2 are the sizes of the two input arrays. This is because we can find the median by comparing elements from both arrays until we reach the middle element.

Sample answer:
```
def findMedian(nums1, nums2):
    total = len(nums1) + len(nums2)
    if total % 2 == 1:
        return findKth(nums1, nums2, total // 2 + 1)
    else:
        return (findKth(nums1, nums2, total // 2) + findKth(nums1, nums2, total // 2 + 1)) / 2.0
def findKth(nums1, nums2, k):
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
    if not nums1:
        return nums2[k-1]
    if k == 1:
        return min(nums1[0], nums2[0])
    i = min(k // 2, len(nums1))
    j = k - i
    if nums1[i-1] <= nums2[j-1]:
        return findKth(nums1[i:], nums2, j) 
    else:
        return findKth(nums1, nums2[j:], i)
```
