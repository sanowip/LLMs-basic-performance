[question1]:
Implement a program to find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures.
[answer1]:
Sure, I can provide a solution for this problem in Python. Please note that the time complexity of this solution is O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of the two arrays. This is because we're comparing each element of the first array with each element of the second array.

Here is the Python code:

```python
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    i = 0
    j = 0
    common_elements = []

    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] == arr2[j]:
            common_elements.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1

    return common_elements
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(find_common_elements(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [3, 4, 5]
```

This function works by iterating over both arrays at the same time and comparing the current elements. If the elements are equal, it adds the element to the list of common elements and moves on to the next elements in both arrays. If the element in the first array is smaller, it moves on to the next element in the first array. If the element in the second array is smaller, it moves on to the next element in the second array.

]O(n^2) or O(nlogn) is expected. The following is a O(n^2) solution. you can also sort them first and use two pointers.

```
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    common_elements = []
    for i in range(len(arr1)):
        for j in range(len(arr2)):
            if arr1[i] == arr2[j]:
                # Check if the element is already in the common_elements list
                if arr1[i] not in common_elements:
                    common_elements.append(arr1[i])
    return common_elements
```

:Now the constraint of not using extra data structure is removed, implement one with the best time complexity.
[answer2]
:Sure, here is a Python solution using two pointers. This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.

```python
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    arr1.sort()
    arr2.sort()
    i = 0
    j = 0
    common_elements = []
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] == arr2[j]:
            common_elements.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    return common_elements

# Test the function
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(find_common_elements(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [3, 4, 5]
```

This solution works by first sorting both arrays. Then it uses two pointers, one for each array, to traverse the arrays. If the current elements in both arrays are equal, it adds the element to the result and moves both pointers forward. If the current element in the first array is smaller, it moves the first pointer forward. If the current element in the second array is smaller, it moves the second pointer forward. This process continues until one of the pointers reaches the end of its array.

]Simply use hash table (set or dict) to achieve O(n) time complexity.

```
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    set1 = set(arr1)
    set2 = set(arr2)
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    return list(common_elements)
```
