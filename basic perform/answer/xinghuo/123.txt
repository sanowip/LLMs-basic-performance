[question1]:
Write a simple website in HTML. When a user clicks the button, it shows a random joke from a list of 4 jokes.
[answer1]:
Sure, here is a simple example of how you could create a website with HTML and JavaScript that displays a random joke from a list when a button is clicked.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Random Joke Generator</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        #joke {
            margin-top: 20px;
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Random Joke Generator</h1>
    <button onclick="displayJoke()">Get a Joke</button>
    <p id="joke"></p>

    <script>
        var jokes = [
            "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
            "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!",
            "Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? It was two tired.",
            "Why don't some fish play piano? Because you can't tuna fish!"
        ];

        function displayJoke() {
            var jokeIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);
            document.getElementById('joke').innerHTML = jokes[jokeIndex];
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this code, we have a list of jokes stored in the `jokes` array. When the button is clicked, the `displayJoke` function is called. This function generates a random index into the `jokes` array and then sets the inner HTML of the paragraph with the id "joke" to the joke at that index.

:How to use CSS to change the color of jokes to red?
[answer2]
:You can use CSS to change the color of jokes to red by targeting the HTML element containing the joke and applying the `color` property with the value `red`. Here's an example:

HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Random Joke Generator</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Random Joke Generator</h1>
    <button onclick="displayJoke()">Get a Joke</button>
    <p id="joke"></p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

CSS (styles.css):
```css
#joke {
    color: red;
}
```

JavaScript (script.js):
```javascript
function displayJoke() {
    const jokes = [
        "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
        "Why did the chicken go to the seance? To talk to the other side!",
        "What do you call fake spaghetti? An impasta!",
        "Why don't some animals play cards? Because they're afraid of cheetahs!"
    ];

    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);
    const jokeElement = document.getElementById("joke");
    jokeElement.textContent = jokes[randomIndex];
}
```
