Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
A binary tree is full if all of its vertices have either zero or two children. Let B_n denote the number of full binary trees with n vertices. Implement a function to find B_n.
[answer1]:
To find B_n, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array to store the number of full binary trees with i vertices and j children. We will initialize the first row with 1, as there is only one way to form a full binary tree with 0 vertices (an empty tree). Then, for each subsequent row, we will calculate the number of full binary trees by summing up the number of ways to form a full binary tree with i-1 vertices and either j or j-1 children.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def count_full_binary_trees(n):
    # Create a 2D array to store the number of full binary trees
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Initialize the first row with 1
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 1

    # Calculate the number of full binary trees
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]

    # Return the number of full binary trees with n vertices
    return dp[n][n // 2]

# Test the function
n = 5
print("B_{} = {}".format(n, count_full_binary_trees(n)))
```

This code will output:

```
B_5 = 7
```

So, B_5 is 7.

]Expected answer is dynamic programming shown below. Some chatbot may answer using Catalan number.
Check edge case like when n is even -> return 0.

```python
def full_binary_trees(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1

    for i in range(3, n + 1, 2):
        for j in range(1, i - 1, 2):
            dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1]

    return dp[n]
```
[question2]
:What if the problem changed from a binary tree to a ternary tree?
[answer2]
:A ternary tree is full if all of its vertices have either zero or two or three children. Let T_n denote the number of full ternary trees with n vertices. Implement a function to find T_n.

]DP is still the expected answer. Catalan number is not correct. Check transition equation carefully.

```python
def full_ternary_trees(n):
    if n % 3 != 1:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1

    for i in range(4, n + 1, 3):
        for j in range(1, i - 1, 3):
            for k in range(1, i - j - 1, 3):
                dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[k] * dp[i - j - k - 1]

    return dp[n]
```
