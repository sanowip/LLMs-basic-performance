Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
x+y = 4z, x*y = 4z^2, express x-y in z
[answer1]:
We can start by expressing x and y in terms of z. From the first equation, we have:

$x=4z-y$

From the second equation, we have:

$xy=4z^2$

Substituting $x=4z-y$ into the second equation, we get:

$(4z-y)y=4z^2$

Expanding this out, we get:

$4zy-y^2=4z^2$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$\sqrt{4zy-y^2}=\sqrt{4z^2}$

This gives us two possible solutions for $y$ : $y=2z$ or $y=-2z$. If $y=2z$, we can substitute this into our first equation to solve for x: $x=4z-2z=2z$. If $y=-2z$, we can substitute this into our first equation to solve for x: $x=4z+2z=6z$. Thus, the solutions are $x=2z$ and $x=6z$. Since we want to find $x-y$, we can subtract either solution from the other to find the answer. Here, we will subtract the solution where $y=2z$ from the other solution where $y=-2z$ : $\begin{aligned} x-y&=6z-(2z) \\ \\ &=4z \end{aligned}$ Therefore, the answer is $x-y=4z$.

Very simple. just (x+y)^2 - 4xy = (4z)^2 - 4*4z^2 = 0 = (x-y)^2
so x-y = 0.

](-1/2)y

z-x = z - 2z = -z = (-1/2)y
