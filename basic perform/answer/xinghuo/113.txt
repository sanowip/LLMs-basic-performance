Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
In a survey conducted at a local high school, preferences for a new school color were measured: 58% of students liked the color blue, 45% preferred green, and 22% liked both colors. If we randomly pick a student from the school, what's the probability that they would like neither blue nor green?
[answer1]:
We can use the complement principle to solve this problem without too much nasty casework. The complement is "not blue" and "not green", so if we know that 48\% of students prefer blue and 37\% prefer green, we can figure out that 0.48 + 0.37 = 0.85, or 85\% of students prefer one of the two colors. That means 100\% - 85\% = 15\% of students don't like either color. So if we pick a student at random, the probability that they don't like blue or green is $\boxed{15\%}$.

[question2]
:If we select a student liked green, what's the probability that he or she would dislike both colors?
[answer2]
:The probability that a randomly selected student likes green is 45%. If we assume that liking one color does not affect the probability of liking or disliking the other color, then the probability that a student who likes green also dislikes blue would be 100% - 22% = 78%. Therefore, the probability that a student who likes green would dislike both colors is (100% - 78%) / 2 = 16%.
