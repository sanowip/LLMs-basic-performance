Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
Write a C++ program to find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
[answer1]:
Sure, I can help with that. Here is a simple C++ program to find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the position of the Fibonacci number you want to find: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "The " << n << "th Fibonacci number is: " << fibonacci(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This program prompts the user to enter a position and then it calculates the Fibonacci number at that position using the `fibonacci` function. The `fibonacci` function uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number. Please note that this approach has an exponential time complexity due to the repeated calculations involved in the recursion. For large values of `n`, it's better to use dynamic programming or matrix exponentiation to calculate Fibonacci numbers efficiently.

]Straightforward

```
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
```

:Now we define a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the three preceding ones. The first three numbers are 0, -1, -1. Write a program to find the nth number.
[answer2]
:Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple C++ program that uses recursion to find the nth number in this sequence:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2) + fibonacci(n - 3);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter the position of the number in the sequence: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "The number at position " << n << " is: " << fibonacci(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This program first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 1 or 2, it returns -1. Otherwise, it recursively calls `fibonacci` with `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n - 3`, and returns the sum of these three values.

Please note that this program has an exponential time complexity due to the repeated computations involved in the recursive calls. For large values of `n`, it may be slow. A more efficient solution would use dynamic programming to store and reuse previously computed values.

]You should carefully check the inital cases for n < 3

```
int find_nth_number(int n) {
    std::vector<int> sequence = {0, -1, -1};
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        int next_number = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i - 3];
        sequence.push_back(next_number);
    }
    return sequence[n];
}
```
