[question1]:
Benjamin went to a bookstore and purchased a variety of books. He bought 5 copies of a sci-fi novel, each priced at $20, 3 copies of a history book priced at $30 each, and 2 copies of a philosophy book for $45 each.
What was the total cost of his purchases?
[answer1]:
The cost of the sci-fi novels is 5 × $20 = $100.

The cost of the history books is 3 × $30 = $90.

The cost of the philosophy books is 2 × $45 = $90.

[question2]
:Suppose Benjamin decides to sell each of these books at a 25% markup from the price he purchased them. What would be his total revenue if he sold all the books he bought?
[answer2]
:How much did Benjamin buy each book for? *  * Benjamin bought each of the books at a cost of $20 x 5 = $100.

How much did Benjamin sell each book for? *  * He sold each of them at a 25\% markup, so he sold each one for $20 x 1.25 = $25.

How much did Benjamin earn from selling each book? *  * Benjamin earned $25 x 5 = $125 from selling all the sci-fi novels.

How much did Benjamin earn from selling each book? *  * He also earned $30 x 3 = $90 from selling the history books.

How much did Benjamin earn from selling each book? *  * And he also earned $45 x 2 = $90 from selling the philosophy books.

What was his total revenue? *  * So, his total revenue from all the books he bought is $125 + $90 + $90 = $305.
