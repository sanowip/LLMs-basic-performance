Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
The vertices of a triangle are at points (0, 0), (-1, 1), and (3, 3). What is the area of the triangle?
[answer1]:
The distance between each pair of points is $\sqrt{(-1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{2}$, and the distance between the points $(0, 0)$ and $(3, 3)$ is $\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$. The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 3$.

]Area is 3
[question2]
:What's area of the circle circumscribing the triangle?
[answer2]
:The circumradius of the triangle is $\sqrt{(3-0)^2The circumradius of the triangle is $\sqrt{(3-0)^2+(3-0)^2}=\sqrt{18}$.  The area of the circle is $\pi\times (\sqrt{18})^2=\boxed{18\pi}$.
