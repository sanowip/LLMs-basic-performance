[question1]:
Write a function to find the highest common ancestor (not LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
[answer1]:
Sure, I can help with that. The problem statement asks for the highest common ancestor (not lowest common ancestor) of two nodes in a binary tree. This means we need to find the deepest node which is an ancestor of both nodes.

Here's a Python solution using recursion:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def find_path(root, path, k):
    if root is None:
        return False

    path.append(root.key)

    if root.key == k:
        return True

    if ((root.left != None and find_path(root.left, path, k)) or
            (root.right!= None and find_path(root.right, path, k))):
        return True

    path.pop()
    return False

def find_lca(root, n1, n2):
    path1 = []
    path2 = []

    if (not find_path(root, path1, n1) or not find_path(root, path2, n2)):
        return -1

    i = 0
    while(i < len(path1) and i < len(path2)):
        if path1[i] != path2[i]:
            break
        i += 1
    return path1[i-1]
```

In this code, `Node` is a class representing a node in the binary tree. `find_path` is a helper function that finds a path from the root to a given node and stores it in a list. `find_lca` uses `find_path` to find paths from the root to the two nodes, then compares these paths to find the last common node, which is the highest common ancestor.

]Very simple. The function should just return the root of the tree.
[question2]
:What if it is not a binary tree?
[answer2]
:The problem of finding the highest common ancestor (H.C.A) in a binary tree can be solved by using a recursive approach. However, if we consider a general tree where each node can have any number of children, then the problem becomes more complex and cannot be solved using the same approach.

Here is a Python solution for finding the H.C.A in a general tree:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.data = key
        self.children = []

def find_path(root, path, k):
    if root is None:
        return False

    path.append(root.data)

    if root.data == k:
        return True

    for child in root.children:
        if find_path(child, path, k):
            return True

    path.pop()
    return False

def find_common_ancestor(root, n1, n2):
    path1 = []
    path2 = []

    if not find_path(root, path1, n1) or not find_path(root, path2, n2):
        return -1

    i = 0
    while i < len(path1) and i < len(path2):
        if path1[i] != path2[i]:
            break
        i += 1
    return path1[i-1]
```
In this code, we first define a `Node` class to create nodes of the tree. Each node has a `data` attribute to store the value of the node and a `children` list to store its children. The `find_path` function is used to find the path from the root to a given node. The `find_common_ancestor` function uses the `find_path` function to find the paths from the root to two given nodes and then finds the last common element in these paths which is the H.C.A.

]Same answer. It's still the root of the tree.
