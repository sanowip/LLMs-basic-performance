Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
Write a function to find the majority element in a given integer array using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.
[answer1]:
Sure, here is a Python solution using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the majority element in an array where the majority element appears more than n/2 times.

```python
def majority_element(nums):
    count = 0
    candidate = None

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

    # Verify if the candidate is the majority element
    return [n for n in nums if n == candidate]

# Test the function
print(majority_element([3,2,3]))
```

In this code, we initialize a counter `count` and a candidate for the majority element `candidate`. We iterate over the array, and for each number, if the counter is 0, we set the current number as the candidate. Then, if the current number is equal to the candidate, we increment the counter, otherwise we decrement it. After the loop, we verify if the candidate is indeed the majority element by checking if it appears more than n/2 times in the array. If it does, we return it; otherwise, we return an empty list.

]Check if they implement the classical algorithm correctly.

Sample answer:
```
def majority_element(arr):
    count = 0
    candidate = None
    # Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
    for num in arr:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)
    # Verify if the candidate is indeed the majority element
    if arr.count(candidate) > len(arr) // 2:
        return candidate
    else:
        return None
```
[question2]
:How about finding the top-2 most occurring elements?
[answer2]
:Write a function to find the top-2 most occurring elements in a given integer array using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.

]There is no simple modification based on the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. Expected answer is to use a hash table.

```
def topTwo(nums):
    # Build a frequency map
    frequency_map = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in frequency_map:
            frequency_map[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency_map[num] = 1

    # Find the top two most occurring elements
    most_frequent = sorted(frequency_map.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:2]

    return [num for num, _ in most_frequent]
```
