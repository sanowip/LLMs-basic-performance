Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
When a number is divided by 10, the remainder is 4. What is the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4?
[answer1]:
If our number is $n$, then $n \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$. So, we have $$n = 10 k + 4$$

where $k$ is an integer.

Now, we need to find the remainder when $2n$ is divided by 4. We have:

$$2n = 2(10 k + 4) = 20k + 8$$

So, the remainder when $2n$ is divided by 4 is $\boxed{8}$.

2 * (10x+4) = 20x + 8 = 4 * (5x+2) + 0

[question2]
:What about when twice the number is divided by 5?
[answer2]
:We can use the rule dividend = divisor * remainder to find the remainder of two divided numbers.

The first number is $4/10$, so its remainder is $4$. The second number is $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. When we divide this by $5$, the remainder is $\boxed{3}$.

20x + 8 = 5 * (4x + 1) + 3
