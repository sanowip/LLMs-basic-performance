You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
A tech startup invests $8000 in software development in the first year, and then invests half of that amount in software development in the second year.
What's the total amount the startup invested in software development over the two years?
[answer1]:
Over two years, the tech startup has invested a total of $16,000 in software development. The first year, it invested $8,000, and the second year it invested half of that amount, which is $4,000. Therefore, the total amount invested over two years is $8,000 + $4,000 = $12,000 + $4,000 = $16,000.

[question2]
:If the startup maintains the same strategy for the third year, investing half of the previous year's amount into software development, how much will they invest in the third year?
[answer2]
:Assuming the startup continues to maintain the same strategy for the third year, investing half of the previous year's amount into software development, they will invest $4,000 into software development in the third year. This is because they invested $4,000 in the second year, and half of that amount ($2,000) will be invested again in the third year. Therefore, their total investment in software development over three years will be $8,000 + $4,000 = $12,000 + $4,000 = $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.
