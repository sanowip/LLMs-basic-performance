[question1]:
Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, half of the people got down and 4 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 6 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?
[answer1]:
If at the terminal 5 people got on the bus, then half of them (5/2 = 2.5) would get off at the first stop and another 4 would board, resulting in 6 total getting off at the first stop. At the second stop, 6 people would get off and another 8 would board, for a total of 14 getting off. Therefore, the remaining 25 people were all getting on the bus at the third stop, so there were a total of 25 people on the bus at the terminal. Therefore, there were a total of 27 people who got on the bus at the terminal.
