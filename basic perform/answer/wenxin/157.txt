Describe five key principles in evaluating an argument in analytical writing.
[answer1]:
When evaluating an argument in analytical writing, there are five key principles that you should follow to ensure a thorough and objective analysis:

1. **Identify the Issue**: The first step is to clearly identify the issue or problem being discussed. This should be done in the introduction or introduction paragraph, where you provide background information and explain why the issue is important.
2. **Analyze the Argument**: Once you have identified the issue, you need to carefully analyze the argument presented by the author. Look for logical fallacies, gaps in reasoning, and evidence that supports or refutes the argument. Be sure to provide sufficient evidence to support your analysis.
3. **Present a Counterargument**: It is important to present a counterargument to the author's claim, explaining why their reasoning may be flawed or incorrect. This can help show readers why their position may be flawed or biased.
4. **Compare and Contrast**: When evaluating an argument, it is important to compare and contrast it with other arguments or perspectives. This helps show readers why one argument may be more valid or convincing than others.
5. **Conclusion**: Finally, provide a conclusion that summarizes your analysis and highlights any strengths or weaknesses of the argument. It should also indicate whether you agree or disagree with the author's position and why.

By following these five key principles, you can evaluate an argument in analytical writing effectively and provide a thorough and objective analysis of the issue at hand.

The following is a memorandum from the advertising head of Zorblatt Animal Outlets, a chain operating thirty animal outlets globally.

"Half a decade ago, our rival Aquatic Pavilion started publicizing in Rare Pets Digest periodical. Their overall sales have been consistently growing at a rate of 3-to-5 percent each year since then. In particular, the Aquatic Pavilion outlet in Harbor Town experienced even more significant growth, securing the title of the most frequented animal store in the United States the previous year. In contrast, our two Zorblatt outlets in Harbor Town have recorded a consistent drop in sales during the same duration. It is evident that we must promptly start featuring our own advertisements in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications. If we take this step, we can confidently anticipate a reversal in this recent trend of decreasing sales and return to profitability."

:The specific evidence needed to evaluate this argument includes a review of the specific advertising and marketing strategies employed by Zorblatt and Aquatic Pavilion. If the analysis demonstrates that Aquatic Pavilion has consistently utilized specific types of advertisements or marketing campaigns, this would support their growth and success in sales. Conversely, if Zorblatt has also been utilizing similar advertising and marketing strategies but has not seen the same success, this would weaken the argument that only advertising in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications would reverse the trend of decreasing sales.

Moreover, it would be helpful to review the sales data for both Zorblatt and Aquatic Pavilion in Harbor Town, as well as their competitors, to see if there are any significant differences in their sales trends that could explain the differences in growth rates. If there are significant differences in pricing, product selection, or customer service that could affect sales, this would also provide evidence that advertising in Rare Pets Digest would not necessarily reverse the trend of decreasing sales.

In conclusion, specific evidence such as advertising and marketing strategies, sales data, and competitive analysis would help to determine whether advertising in Rare Pets Digest would indeed strengthen or weaken the argument.

To strengthen the argument, evidence would be needed that demonstrates Zorblatt's sales decline is not due to factors such as pricing, product selection, or customer service. Additionally, evidence showing that Zorblatt's advertising and marketing strategies are not effective enough to reverse the trend of decreasing sales would also support the argument.

On the other hand, if evidence showed that Zorblatt's advertising and marketing strategies were effective enough to reverse the trend of decreasing sales, this would strengthen the argument that advertising in Rare Pets Digest would also have a positive impact on sales.
