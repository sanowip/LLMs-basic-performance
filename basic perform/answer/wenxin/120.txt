Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
Given that f(x) = 4x^3 - 9x - 14, find the value of f(2).
[answer1]:
To find the value of f(2), you simply plug in the value of x=2 into the formula for f(x). The formula for f(x) is f(x) = 4x^3 - 9x - 14. So, if we replace x with 2, we get:

f(2) = 4(2)^3 - 9(2) - 14

= 4*8 - 18 - 14

= 32 - 32

= 0

Therefore, the value of f(2) is 0.

]f(2) = 0
[question2]
:Find x such that f(x) = 0.
[answer2]
:To find x such that f(x) = 0, you simply solve the equation f(x) = 0. In this case, f(x) = 4x^3 - 9x - 14. To solve this equation, you need to find x for which this expression is equal to 0. You can use a calculator or a computer program to solve this equation for x. The solution will be x = -1 or x = 4.

If you want to find the value of x for which f(x) = 0, you can plug in the value of x into the formula for f(x) and solve for x. In this case, if x = -1, then f(-1) = 0. If x = 4, then f(4) = 0. Therefore, x = -1 or x = 4 are solutions to the equation f(x) = 0.
