[question1]:
Write a simple website in HTML. When a user clicks the button, it shows a random joke from a list of 4 jokes.
[answer1]:
Sure! Here's a simple HTML website that displays a random joke when a button is clicked. The jokes are stored in a JavaScript array and randomly selected each time the button is clicked.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Random Joke Website</title>
  <style>
    #joke-container {
      text-align: center;
    }
    .joke {
      margin: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="random-joke-button">Show Random Joke</button>
  <div id="joke-container"></div>

  <script>
    // Jokes array
    var jokes = [
      "Why don't skeletons fight each other?",
      "They don't have the guts!",
      "What do skeletons and dogs have in common?",
      "They both howl at the moon!"
    ];

    // Get button and container elements
    var button = document.getElementById("random-joke-button");
    var jokeContainer = document.getElementById("joke-container");

    // Add event listener to button
    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
      // Generate a random index from the jokes array
      var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);

      // Display the selected joke in the container div
      jokeContainer.innerHTML = jokes[randomIndex];
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a simple HTML page with a button and a container div. When the button is clicked, a random joke from the `jokes` array is displayed in the container div. The jokes are stored in an array and randomly selected using JavaScript's `Math.random()` function. The selected joke is then displayed in the container div using `innerHTML` to update the content.

:How to use CSS to change the color of jokes to red?
[answer2]
:To change the color of jokes to red using CSS, you can add a class to the joke elements and use the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the color when the cursor hovers over the element. Here's an example:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Random Joke Website</title>
  <style>
    .joke {
      color: black; /* Default color */
    }

    .joke:hover {
      color: red; /* Hover color */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="random-joke-button">Show Random Joke</button>
  <div id="joke-container"></div>

  <script>
    // Jokes array
    var jokes = [
      "Why don't skeletons fight each other?",
      "They don't have the guts!",
      "What do skeletons and dogs have in common?",
      "They both howl at the moon!",
      "Here's a joke: A skeleton and a dog walk into a bar...", // Add this joke with a class of "joke"
    ];

    // Get button and container elements
    var button = document.getElementById("random-joke-button");
    var jokeContainer = document.getElementById("joke-container");

    // Add event listener to button
    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
      // Generate a random index from the jokes array and add a class of "joke" to the element
      var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);
      var jokeElement = document.createElement("p"); // Create a new paragraph element for the joke
      jokeElement.className = "joke"; // Add the "joke" class to the element
      jokeContainer.appendChild(jokeElement); // Add the element to the container div
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example, I added a CSS class of `joke` to the joke elements and used the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the color to red when the cursor hovers over the element. When you click the button, a new joke element is created with the `joke` class and appended to the container div. When you hover over the joke element, it will display in red. You can modify the CSS to change the default color as well if you want.
