Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
The vertices of a triangle are at points (0, 0), (-1, 1), and (3, 3). What is the area of the triangle?
[answer1]:
The area of a triangle is usually calculated using the formula A = 1/2 * base * height, where base is the distance between the two sides of the triangle that meet at the vertex, and height is the distance from that vertex to the opposite side.

For the triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (-1, 1), and (3, 3), the base is 4 units (the difference between (-1, 1) and (3, 3)), and the height is the distance from (-1, 1) to (0, 0), which is sqrt(2).

So the area of the triangle is A = 1/2 * 4 * sqrt(2) = 2 sqrt(2).

Therefore, the area of the triangle is approximately 2.82843.

[question2]
:What's area of the circle circumscribing the triangle?
[answer2]
:The area of the circle circumscribing the triangle is equal to the area of the triangle. The formula for calculating the area of a triangle is A = 1/2 * base * height, and the formula for calculating the area of a circle is πr² (where r is the radius). Since the triangle and the circumscribing circle have the same base and height, their areas are equal.

Therefore, the area of the circle circumscribing the triangle is approximately 2.82843.
