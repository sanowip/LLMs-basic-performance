[question1]:
Implement a program to find the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures.
[answer1]:
Here's an implementation of a program in Python that finds the common elements in two arrays without using any extra data structures:


```python
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    # Initialize a set to store the elements of arr1
    set1 = set(arr1)
    # Iterate through arr2 and remove any elements that are not in set1
    for element in arr2:
        if element not in set1:
            set1.remove(element)
    # Convert the set back to a list and return it
    return list(set1)

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(find_common_elements(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [3, 4, 5]
```
In this implementation, we use a set to store the elements of `arr1` to avoid duplicates. We iterate through `arr2` and remove any elements that are not in the set. After removing the duplicates, we convert the set back to a list and return it as the common elements.

This method has O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array. It avoids the use of any extra data structures and is suitable for small to medium-sized arrays. However, if you need to process large arrays, you may consider using a data structure like a hash set or a dictionary to store the elements.
[refence1]:
]O(n^2) or O(nlogn) is expected. The following is a O(n^2) solution. you can also sort them first and use two pointers.

```
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    common_elements = []
    for i in range(len(arr1)):
        for j in range(len(arr2)):
            if arr1[i] == arr2[j]:
                # Check if the element is already in the common_elements list
                if arr1[i] not in common_elements:
                    common_elements.append(arr1[i])
    return common_elements
```
[question2]
:Now the constraint of not using extra data structure is removed, implement one with the best time complexity.
[answer2]
:If you no longer have the constraint of not using extra data structures, then you can use a set data structure to find the common elements in two arrays with the best time complexity. Here's an implementation in Python:


```python
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    # Convert both arrays to sets to remove duplicates
    set1 = set(arr1)
    set2 = set(arr2)
    # Find the intersection of the two sets
    common_elements = set1 & set2
    # Convert the intersection back to a list and return it
    return list(common_elements)

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(find_common_elements(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [3, 4, 5]
```
In this implementation, we use a set data structure to store the elements of both arrays. This allows us to remove duplicates efficiently and avoid creating unnecessary intermediate data structures. After finding the intersection of the two sets, we convert it back to a list and return it as the common elements. This method has O(m + n) time complexity, where m and n are the lengths of the arrays. It is still an efficient solution for large arrays, but it may not be suitable for very small arrays due to the additional memory required for the set data structure.
[refence2]:
]Simply use hash table (set or dict) to achieve O(n) time complexity.

```
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    set1 = set(arr1)
    set2 = set(arr2)
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    return list(common_elements)
```
