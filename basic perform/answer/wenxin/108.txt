[question1]:
Which word does not belong with the others?
tyre, steering wheel, car, engine
[answer1]:
"Tyre" does not belong with "steering wheel", "car", and "engine" because it is a component of a car, but not the actual wheel or engine. "Tyre" is a component of the car that provides traction and support for the wheels. "Steering wheel", "car", and "engine" are all parts of a car that directly affect its operation and functionality.
[refence1]:
]Car does not belong because all others are components of a car.
[question2]
:Could you replace it with a word that belongs with the others?
[answer2]
:To better align these words, I suggest replacing "Tyre" with "wheels". "Wheels" is a component of a car that provides traction and support for the tyres, and is therefore closely related to the steering wheel, car, and engine.
