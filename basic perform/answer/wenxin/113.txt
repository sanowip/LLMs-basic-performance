Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
In a survey conducted at a local high school, preferences for a new school color were measured: 58% of students liked the color blue, 45% preferred green, and 22% liked both colors. If we randomly pick a student from the school, what's the probability that they would like neither blue nor green?
[answer1]:
To find the probability that a randomly selected student at the school likes neither blue nor green, we can use the following formula:

100% - (58% + 45% - 22%) = 45%

So, the probability that a randomly selected student at the school likes neither blue nor green is 45%.
