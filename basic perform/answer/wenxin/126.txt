[question1]:
Implement a function to find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes with O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
[answer1]:
To find the median of two sorted arrays of different sizes with O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity, you can use the following Python function:


```python
def find_median(arr1, arr2):
    # Sort the two arrays
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr1 + arr2)

    # Calculate the middle element using the size of the larger array
    middle = len(sorted_arr) // 2

    # Check if the arrays have an odd or even number of elements
    if len(arr1) + len(arr2) % 2 == 1:
        return sorted_arr[middle]
    else:
        # If the sum of the array sizes is odd, return the average of the two middle elements
        return (sorted_arr[middle - 1] + sorted_arr[middle]) / 2
```
Here's how you can use this function:


```python
arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6]
print(find_median(arr1, arr2))  # Output: 3.5
```
The function sorts the two arrays using the Python `sorted()` function and then calculates the middle element using the size of the larger array. If the sum of the array sizes is odd, it returns the average of the two middle elements. This approach ensures that the function has O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity, where n is the total number of elements in both arrays.

    n2 = len(arr2)
    if (n1 + n2) == 0:
        return None

    i, j = 0, 0
    last_1, last_2 = None, None

    for k in range(1, (n1 + n2) // 2 + 2):
        last_2 = last_1
        if j == n2:
            last_1 = arr1[i]
            i += 1
        elif i == n1:
            last_1 = arr2[j]
            j += 1
        elif arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            last_1 = arr1[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            last_1 = arr2[j]
            j += 1
        
    if (n1 + n2) % 2 == 1:
        return last_1
    else:
        return (last_1 + last_2) / 2
```
[question2]
:Does there exist an implementation with better time complexity?
[answer2]
:The implementation you described above has an O(n) time complexity, which is acceptable for most cases. However, there may be other more efficient implementations that can achieve better time complexity, but these may involve more complex algorithms or data structures.

One possible implementation that could potentially achieve better time complexity is using a merge sort algorithm. In merge sort, the two sorted arrays are first merged together using a divide and conquer approach, which has an O(n log n) time complexity. However, the merge operation itself requires more computational resources than sorting operations.

Another approach would be to use a median-of-medians algorithm, which first sorts both arrays and then finds the median using two other sorted arrays that represent the first and last elements of each array. This approach also has a O(n log n) time complexity.

However, it should be noted that the trade-off between time complexity and space complexity needs to be carefully considered depending on the specific use case. In most cases, the implementation you described above with an O(n) time complexity is sufficient for most practical applications.

Sample answer:
```
def findMedian(nums1, nums2):
    total = len(nums1) + len(nums2)
    if total % 2 == 1:
        return findKth(nums1, nums2, total // 2 + 1)
    else:
        return (findKth(nums1, nums2, total // 2) + findKth(nums1, nums2, total // 2 + 1)) / 2.0
def findKth(nums1, nums2, k):
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
    if not nums1:
        return nums2[k-1]
    if k == 1:
        return min(nums1[0], nums2[0])
    i = min(k // 2, len(nums1))
    j = k - i
    if nums1[i-1] <= nums2[j-1]:
        return findKth(nums1[i:], nums2, j) 
    else:
        return findKth(nums1, nums2[j:], i)
