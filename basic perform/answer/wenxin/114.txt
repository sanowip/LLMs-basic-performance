Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
When rolling two dice, what is the probability that you roll a total number that is at least 3?
[answer1]:
When rolling two dice, the probability of rolling a total number that is at least 3 is (3 + 2 + 1)/6 = 6/6 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability is 50%.
[refence1]:
]36 (all cases) - 0 (sum equals 1) - 1 (sum equals 2) = 35, so the probability is 35/36
[question2]
:Continue from previous question. What's the probability that you roll a number which is even or at least 3?
[answer2]
:When rolling two dice, the probability of rolling an even number is 1/2, and the probability of rolling a number that is at least 3 is (3 + 2)/6 = 5/6. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number that is even or at least 3 is (1/2) + (5/6) = 3/4.
