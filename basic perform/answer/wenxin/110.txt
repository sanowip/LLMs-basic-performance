Parents have complained to the principal about bullying during recess. The principal wants to quickly resolve this, instructing recess aides to be vigilant. Which situation should the aides report to the principal?
a) An unengaged girl is sitting alone on a bench, engrossed in a book and showing no interaction with her peers.
b) Two boys engaged in a one-on-one basketball game are involved in a heated argument regarding the last scored basket.
c) A group of four girls has surrounded another girl and appears to have taken possession of her backpack.
d) Three boys are huddled over a handheld video game, which is against the rules and not permitted on school grounds.
[answer1]:
The aides should report to the principal the situation where four girls have surrounded another girl and appear to have taken possession of her backpack, because this situation involves bullying during recess. Bullying is a serious issue that needs to be addressed quickly and effectively. The aides should investigate the situation and take appropriate action to protect the victim and prevent further bullying. On the other hand, the other situations mentioned are not related to bullying and can be handled by other staff or students. Therefore, the aides should report the situation involving bullying to the principal.

[question2]
:If the aides confront the group of girls from situation (c) and they deny bullying, stating that they were merely playing a game, what specific evidence should the aides look for to determine if this is a likely truth or a cover-up for bullying?
[answer2]
:If the aides confront the group of girls in situation (c) and they deny bullying, stating that they were merely playing a game, the aides should look for specific evidence to determine if this is the truth or a cover-up for bullying. Some specific evidence that the aides should look for include:

1. Video recordings or photos of the incident: If possible, take pictures or videos of the situation to prove what happened.

2. Testimonies from other students or witnesses: Interview other students or witnesses who may have witnessed the incident to see if they can provide any additional information or confirm the story of the girls.

3. Time and location: Make sure to note the time and location of the incident to determine if it happened during recess and if it was in a designated area on school grounds.

4. Behavior of the girls: If the girls' behavior is consistent with bullying behavior, such as isolating a student, taking items from them, or threatening them, this may indicate bullying.

5. Behavior of other students: Observe other students' reaction and behavior during and after the incident. If they seem to be scared or avoiding interacting with the targeted student, this may indicate bullying.

After collecting and analyzing this evidence, the aides should present it to the principal to help make a decision about whether there was bullying or not. If there was bullying, the aides should take appropriate action to protect the victim and prevent further bullying. If there was no bullying, then the aides should explain the situation to the girls and remind them of the importance of respecting others and abiding by school rules.
