[question1]:
When a number is divided by 10, the remainder is 4. What is the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4?
[answer1]:
Let's solve this problem together.

The number is divided by 10 with a remainder of 4, which means that the number can be expressed as n + 4 for some integer n.

To find the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4, we need to multiply the original number by 2 and then divide by 4. So, let's find out what n would be such that 2(n + 4) is divisible by 4.

Since 2(n + 4) = 2n + 8, we need to find out what integer n would make this even number. So we have two cases:

Case 1: If n is 1, then 2(n + 4) = 6. When n is subtracted from it, the remainder becomes 4 (after the division).
Case 2: If n is greater than 1, the expression (2n + 8) becomes an odd number after subtracting n.

So the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4 is also 4.

Therefore, the answer is 4.

2 * (10x+4) = 20x + 8 = 4 * (5x+2) + 0

[question2]
:What about when twice the number is divided by 5?
[answer2]
:When the number is doubled, it becomes 2n + 8. Now let's find out what integer n would make this number divisible by 5.

We have two cases:

Case 1: If n is 0, then 2n + 8 = 8. After subtracting n from it, the remainder becomes 3 (after the division).

Case 2: If n is greater than 0, the expression (2n + 8) becomes an odd number after subtracting n.

Therefore, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is also 3.

20x + 8 = 5 * (4x + 1) + 3
