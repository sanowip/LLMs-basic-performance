Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
One morning after sunrise, Suresh was standing facing a pole. The shadow of the pole fell exactly to his right. Can you tell me the direction towards which the shadow was pointing - east, south, west, or north? Explain your reasoning steps.
[answer1]:
After sunrise, the shadow of a pole would naturally point towards the sun, which is usually in the east. The sun is a bright source of light, so its shadow would be easily visible. Therefore, the shadow of the pole falling exactly to Suresh's right would indicate that it was pointing towards the east.

To confirm this, we can use our knowledge of the Earth's rotation and the relative positions of the sun, pole, and Suresh. As the Earth rotates, the sun would appear to move across the sky from east to west. Therefore, if the shadow of the pole fell to Suresh's right, it would indicate that he was facing east.

In summary, based on our reasoning steps, we can conclude that the shadow was pointing towards the east. We used our knowledge of Earth's rotation, the relative positions of the sun and pole, and the visibility of shadows after sunrise to arrive at this conclusion.

]West
[question2]
:To which direction was Suresh facing? How do you solve this?
[answer2]
:Based on the description provided, Suresh was facing east.

To solve this question, we can use our knowledge of Earth's rotation and the relative positions of the sun, pole, and Suresh. As the Earth rotates, the sun would appear to move across the sky from east to west. If the shadow of the pole fell to Suresh's right, it would indicate that he was facing east. 

This is supported by our reasoning steps which includes our knowledge of Earth's rotation, the relative positions of the sun and pole, and the visibility of shadows after sunrise.

Therefore, Suresh was facing east.
