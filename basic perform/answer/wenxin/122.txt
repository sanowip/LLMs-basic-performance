Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
Write a C++ program to find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
[answer1]:
Here's a C++ program that finds the nth Fibonacci number using recursion:


```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "The " << n << "th Fibonacci number is: " << fibonacci(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this program, the `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function simply returns `n`. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively to find the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the nth number.

The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the corresponding Fibonacci number.

]Straightforward

```
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
```
[question2]
:Now we define a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the three preceding ones. The first three numbers are 0, -1, -1. Write a program to find the nth number.
[answer2]
:Here's a program in Python that finds the nth number in the sequence you described:


```python
def find_nth_number(n):
    # First three numbers are 0, -1, -1
    a, b, c = 0, -1, -1
    # Iterate from 4th number onwards
    for _ in range(n - 3):
        a = b + c
        # Keep track of the last two numbers
        b = c
        c = a
    return a

# Ask the user for the index
index = int(input("Enter the index of the number: "))
print("The {}th number is: {}".format(index, find_nth_number(index)))
```
This program defines a function `find_nth_number` that takes an index `n` and returns the nth number in the sequence. It starts with the first three numbers (0, -1, -1) and iterates from the fourth number onwards. It keeps track of the last two numbers using `b` and `c` variables, and updates them with the sum of the previous two numbers each iteration. Finally, it returns the nth number.

The program then prompts the user for the index of the number they want to find and prints the corresponding result.

]You should carefully check the inital cases for n < 3

```
int find_nth_number(int n) {
    std::vector<int> sequence = {0, -1, -1};
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        int next_number = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i - 3];
        sequence.push_back(next_number);
    }
    return sequence[n];
}
```
