Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
Write a function to find the highest common ancestor (not LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
[answer1]:
To find the highest common ancestor (HCA) of two nodes in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach, maintaining a pointer to the ancestor as we explore the tree. However, in a binary tree, unlike a regular graph, we can only have a single HCA for any pair of nodes. Therefore, we need to ensure that we do not return the same ancestor twice.

Here's an implementation in Python:


```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_highest_common_ancestor(root: TreeNode, node1: TreeNode, node2: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    if not root or root == node1 or root == node2:
        return None

    # Initialize ancestor as the root node
    ancestor = root

    # Iterate through the tree
    while ancestor != node1 and ancestor != node2:
        # If node1 is found in the left subtree of ancestor, go to the left child of ancestor
        if node1 and ancestor.left and ancestor.left == node1:
            ancestor = ancestor.left
        # If node2 is found in the right subtree of ancestor, go to the right child of ancestor
        elif node2 and ancestor.right and ancestor.right == node2:
            ancestor = ancestor.right
        # Otherwise, go to the parent of ancestor
        else:
            ancestor = ancestor.parent

    return ancestor
```
Here's an example usage:


```python
# Create a binary tree with the following structure:
#     10
#    /   \
#   20   30
#  / \   / \
# 40  50 60  70
root = TreeNode(10)
root.left = TreeNode(20)
root.right = TreeNode(30)
root.left.left = TreeNode(40)
root.left.right = TreeNode(50)
root.right.left = TreeNode(60)
root.right.right = TreeNode(70)

node1 = root.left  # Node 20's parent is HCA of 20 and 30
node2 = TreeNode(30)  # Node 30 is also HCA of 20 and 30 because it's closer to both nodes than their parents

print(find_highest_common_ancestor(root, node1, node2))  # Output: 10 (The HCA is node 10)
```
In this example, we are looking for the HCA of nodes 20 and 30, which is their common parent node 10. Note that if we had more nodes that shared this common ancestor, this function would still return 10 because it's the closest ancestor to both nodes that isn't already in the result set.

]Very simple. The function should just return the root of the tree.
[question2]
:What if it is not a binary tree?
[answer2]
:If it's not a binary tree, the algorithm for finding the highest common ancestor still applies. However, the structure of the tree will affect the efficiency of the algorithm. In a general tree, DFS can be used to find the HCA, but in a general graph, the algorithm may become more complex and time-consuming. If the tree is not binary, you may need to consider other data structures or algorithms to solve the problem.
[refence2]:
]Same answer. It's still the root of the tree.
