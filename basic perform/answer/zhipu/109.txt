You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
One morning after sunrise, Suresh was standing facing a pole. The shadow of the pole fell exactly to his right. Can you tell me the direction towards which the shadow was pointing - east, south, west, or north? Explain your reasoning steps.
[answer1]:
 To determine the direction towards which the shadow was pointing, we can use the following reasoning steps:

1. Sunrise: The sun rises in the east. Therefore, Suresh was facing the pole on his right, which is to the west.
2. Shadow: The shadow of the pole fell exactly to Suresh's right. Since he was facing the pole, the shadow had to be on his left.
3. Compass directions: If Suresh was facing west and the shadow was on his left, the shadow was pointing towards the north.

So, the shadow was pointing north.
[refence1]:
]West
[question2]
:To which direction was Suresh facing? How do you solve this?
[answer2]
: To solve this problem, we can use the following reasoning steps:

1. Sunrise: The sun rises in the east.
2. Shadow: The shadow of the pole fell exactly to Suresh's right.

Based on these two pieces of information, we can deduce that Suresh was facing the pole on his right, which is to the west.

So, Suresh was facing west.
[refence2]:
]South.
