[question1]:
The vertices of a triangle are at points (0, 0), (-1, 1), and (3, 3). What is the area of the triangle?
[answer1]:
 To find the area of the triangle, we can use the following formula:

Area = 1/2 * base * height

where base is the length of the side opposite the base, and height is the length of the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.

First, let's find the coordinates of the midpoint of the base:

x_mid = (x1 + x2) / 2 = (0 + 3) / 2 = 3/2
y_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2 = (0 + 3) / 2 = 3/2

Now, we'll find the perpendicular distance (height) from the midpoint to the opposite vertex:

sqrt((x2 - x_mid)² + (y2 - y_mid)²) = sqrt((-1 - 3/2)² + (1 - 3/2)²) = sqrt((-5/2)² + (1/2)²) = sqrt(25/4 + 1/4) = sqrt(26/4) = sqrt(13)

Now, we have the base length (3 - (-1)) = 4, and the height (sqrt(13)). Plug these values into the area formula:

Area = 1/2 * 4 * sqrt(13) = 2 * sqrt(13)

So, the area of the triangle is 2 * sqrt(13).

:What's area of the circle circumscribing the triangle?
[answer2]
: To find the area of the circle circumscribing the triangle, we first need to find the circumcenter, which is the center of the circle. The circumcenter is the point of intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle.

First, let's find the perpendicular bisector of the base (AC):

1. Find the midpoint of the base:
x_mid = (x1 + x2) / 2 = (0 + 3) / 2 = 3/2
y_mid = (y1 + y2) / 2 = (0 + 3) / 2 = 3/2

2. Find the slope of the line perpendicular to AC:
slope = (-1 - 0) / (3 - 0) = -1/3

3. Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AC:
y - 3/2 = (-1/3)(x - 3/2)

Now, let's find the perpendicular bisectors of the other two sides (BC and AB):

1. Find the midpoint of side BC:
x_mid_BC = (x3 + x2) / 2 = (-1 + 3) / 2 = 1/2
y_mid_BC = (y3 + y2) / 2 = (3 + 1) / 2 = 2

2. Find the slope of the line perpendicular to BC:
slope_BC = (y2 - y3) / (x2 - x3) = (1 - 3) / (-1 - 3) = 2/4 = 1/2

3. Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of BC:
y - 2 = (1/2)(x - 1/2)

1. Find the perpendicular bisector of side AB:
x_mid_AB = (x1 + x3) / 2 = (0 + 3) / 2 = 3/2
y_mid_AB = (y1 + y3) / 2 = (0 + 3) / 2 = 3/2

2. Find the slope of the line perpendicular to AB:
slope_AB = (y3 - y1) / (x3 - x1) = (3 - 0) / (3 - 0) = 3/3 = 1

3. Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB:
y - 3/2 = 1 * (x - 3/2)

Now, we have the equations of all three perpendicular bisectors:

1. Perpendicular bisector of AC: y - 3/2 = (-1/3)(x - 3/2)
2. Perpendicular bisector of BC: y - 2 = (1/2)(x - 1/2)
3. Perpendicular bisector of AB: y - 3/2 = 1 * (x - 3/2)

The circle circumscribing the triangle is the circle with the center at the circumcenter (intersection of the perpendicular bisectors) and the radius equal to the length of one of the altitudes (perpendicular distance from the circumcenter to one of the vertices).

To find the radius, let's consider the right triangle formed by the perpendicular bisector of AC and the line segment AC. The radius is the hypotenuse of this right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius:

Radius² = hypotenuse² = (AC/2)² + (height_AC)²

where AC/2 is the length of the base of the right triangle, and height_AC is the length of the altitude (perpendicular distance from the circumcenter to the vertex A).

Height_AC = sqrt(13) (previously calculated)

Now, find the length of AC/2:

AC/2 = sqrt((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²) / 2 = sqrt((-1 - 0)² + (1 - 0)²) / 2 = sqrt(2) / 2

Plug these values into the equation for the radius:

Radius² = (sqrt(2) / 2)² + (sqrt(13))² = 2/4 + 13 = 17/4

Now, we have
