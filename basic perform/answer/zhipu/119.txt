Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
Benjamin went to a bookstore and purchased a variety of books. He bought 5 copies of a sci-fi novel, each priced at $20, 3 copies of a history book priced at $30 each, and 2 copies of a philosophy book for $45 each.
What was the total cost of his purchases?
[answer1]:
 To calculate the total cost of Benjamin's purchases, we need to sum up the costs of each type of book.

1. Sci-fi novel: 5 copies × $20 each = $100
2. History book: 3 copies × $30 each = $90
3. Philosophy book: 2 copies × $45 each = $90

Total cost: $100 (sci-fi novel) + $90 (history book) + $90 (philosophy book) = $280

So, the total cost of Benjamin's purchases was $280.

[question2]
:Suppose Benjamin decides to sell each of these books at a 25% markup from the price he purchased them. What would be his total revenue if he sold all the books he bought?
[answer2]
: To calculate Benjamin's total revenue, we need to find the selling price of each type of book and then sum up the revenues from all of them.

1. Sci-fi novel:
   Markup percentage: 25%
   Selling price: $20 × (1 + 25%) = $25
   Revenue: 5 copies × $25 = $125

2. History book:
   Markup percentage: 25%
   Selling price: $30 × (1 + 25%) = $37.5
   Revenue: 3 copies × $37.5 = $112.5

3. Philosophy book:
   Markup percentage: 25%
   Selling price: $45 × (1 + 25%) = $56.25
   Revenue: 2 copies × $56.25 = $112.5

Total revenue: $125 (sci-fi novel) + $112.5 (history book) + $112.5 (philosophy book) = $350

So, Benjamin's total revenue if he sold all the books he bought would be $350.
