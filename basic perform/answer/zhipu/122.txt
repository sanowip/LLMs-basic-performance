Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
Write a C++ program to find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
[answer1]:
 ```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter the number of Fibonacci numbers to find: ";
    std::cin >> n;

    std::cout << "The " << n << "th Fibonacci number is: " << fibonacci(n) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program finds the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. It first checks if the input value `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns the value itself. Otherwise, it calls the function again with `n-1` and `n-2` as the arguments and adds the results to find the nth Fibonacci number.

]Straightforward

```
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
```
[question2]
:Now we define a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the three preceding ones. The first three numbers are 0, -1, -1. Write a program to find the nth number.
[answer2]
: ```cpp
#include <iostream>

int sequence(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else if (n == 2) {
        return sequence(n - 1) + sequence(n - 2) + sequence(n - 3);
    } else {
        return sequence(n - 1) + sequence(n - 2) + sequence(n - 3) + sequence(n - 4) + sequence(n - 5) + sequence(n - 6);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter the number of terms to find the nth number: ";
    std::cin >> n;

    std::cout << "The nth number in the sequence is: " << sequence(n) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program finds the nth number in the sequence where each number is the sum of the three preceding ones. The first three numbers are 0, -1, -1. The function `sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth number in the sequence. If `n` is 1 or 2, it returns the respective number. Otherwise, it calls the function recursively with `n-1`, `n-2`, `n-3`, and so on, until it reaches the base case (n <= 2). Then, it adds the results to find the nth number in the sequence.

]You should carefully check the inital cases for n < 3

```
int find_nth_number(int n) {
    std::vector<int> sequence = {0, -1, -1};
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        int next_number = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i - 3];
        sequence.push_back(next_number);
    }
    return sequence[n];
}
```
