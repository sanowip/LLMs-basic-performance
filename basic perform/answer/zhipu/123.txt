[answer1]:
 Here's a simple HTML website with a button that displays a random joke from a list of 4 jokes when clicked:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Random Joke Website</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            text-align: center;
        }

        button {
            font-size: 24px;
            padding: 10px;
            cursor: pointer;
            background-color: #4CAF50;
            color: white;
            border: none;
            border-radius: 5px;
            margin-top: 20px;
        }

        button:hover {
            background-color: #45a049;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Random Joke Website</h1>
    <p id="joke"></p>
    <button onclick="displayRandomJoke()">Show Random Joke</button>

    <script>
        const jokes = [
            "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
            "Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!",
            "What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear!",
            "Why did the cookie go to the doctor? Because it was feeling crummy!"
        ];

        function displayRandomJoke() {
            const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);
            document.getElementById("joke").innerText = jokes[randomIndex];
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Save this code in a file with the extension .html, and it will create a simple webpage with a button that displays a random joke when clicked. The jokes are stored in the `jokes` array, and the `displayRandomJoke()` function is called when the button is clicked, displaying a random joke from the list.
[question2]
:How to use CSS to change the color of jokes to red?
[answer2]
: To change the color of the jokes to red, you can modify the CSS rule for the `<p>` element containing the jokes. Add a class or ID to the `<p>` element and then create a CSS rule targeting that class or ID. Here's an example:

1. Add a class name `joke-container` to the `<p>` element containing the jokes:

```html
<p class="joke-container">Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!</p>
```

2. Modify the CSS to target the `joke-container` class and set the `color` property to red:

```css
.joke-container {
    color: red;
}
```

Now, the color of the jokes will be red. If you have multiple `<p>` elements with the `joke-container` class, all of them will have their text color changed to red.

Here's the complete HTML and CSS code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Random Joke Website</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            text-align: center;
        }

        button {
            font-size: 24px;
            padding: 10px;
            cursor: pointer;
            background-color: #4CAF50;
            color: white;
            border: none;
            border-radius: 5px;
            margin-top: 20px;
        }

        button:hover {
            background-color: #45a049;
        }

        .joke-container {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Random Joke Website</h1>
    <p class="joke-container">Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!</p>
    <button onclick="displayRandomJoke()">Show Random Joke</button>

    <script>
        const jokes = [
            "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
            "Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!",
            "What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear!",
            "Why did the cookie go to the doctor? Because it was feeling crummy!"
        ];

        function displayRandomJoke() {
            const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);
            document.getElementById("joke").innerText = jokes[randomIndex];
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, the text color of the jokes will be red.
