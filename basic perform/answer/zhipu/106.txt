Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
Each problem consists of three statements. Based on the first two statements, the third statement may be true, false, or uncertain.
1. Oranges cost more than apples.
2. Oranges cost less than bananas.
3. Bananas cost more than apples and bananas cost more than orange.
If the first two statements are true, then the third statement is
[answer1]:
 true. Because if Oranges cost more than apples and Oranges cost less than bananas, then it necessarily follows that Bananas cost more than apples and Bananas cost more than oranges.
[refence1]:
]True.
[question2]
:If the third statement is true. Is the first statement true, false, or uncertain? Please explain.
[answer2]
: If the third statement is true, then the first statement (Oranges cost more than apples) must be false. This is because the third statement compares the cost of bananas with that of apples and oranges, and if bananas cost more than oranges (as stated in the third statement), then oranges cannot cost more than apples. So, if the third statement is true, the first statement is false.
[refence2]:
]Uncertain.
