[question1]:
A tech startup invests $8000 in software development in the first year, and then invests half of that amount in software development in the second year.
What's the total amount the startup invested in software development over the two years?
[answer1]:
 In the first year, the startup invested $8000 in software development. In the second year, they invested half of that amount, which is $8000 / 2 = $4000.

The total amount invested in software development over the two years is $8000 (first year) + $4000 (second year) = $12000.
