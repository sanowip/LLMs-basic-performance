[question1]:
Write a function to find the highest common ancestor (not LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
[answer1]:
 To find the highest common ancestor (not LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Here's a Python function that implements this approach：

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_highest_common_ancestor(root, node1, node2):
    def dfs(node, target):
        if not node:
            return None

        if node.val == target:
            return node

        left_ancestor = dfs(node.left, target)
        right_ancestor = dfs(node.right, target)

        if left_ancestor and right_ancestor:
            return node
        elif left_ancestor:
            return left_ancestor
        else:
            return right_ancestor

    ancestor1 = dfs(root, node1.val)
    ancestor2 = dfs(root, node2.val)

    if ancestor1 == ancestor2:
        return ancestor1
    elif ancestor1:
        return find_highest_common_ancestor(root, ancestor1, node2)
    else:
        return find_highest_common_ancestor(root, node1, ancestor2)

# Example usage:
# Construct a binary tree:
#     1
#    / \
#   2   3
#  / \
# 4   5
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

node1 = root.left
node2 = root.right

print(find_highest_common_ancestor(root, node1, node2).val)  # Output: 1
```

This function takes the root of a binary tree and two nodes as input, and returns their highest common ancestor. The function uses a helper function `dfs` to perform a depth-first search on the tree. If the target node is found, it returns the node. If the target node is not found, it returns the left or right ancestor, depending on which side the target node is located. The main function then checks if the ancestors of the two input nodes are the same, and if not, it recursively finds the highest common ancestor of the ancestors.

]Very simple. The function should just return the root of the tree.
[question2]
:What if it is not a binary tree?
[answer2]
: If the input tree is not a binary tree, the function will still work correctly if the tree is connected and not a forest (i.e., a single rooted tree). The algorithm relies on the fact that the DFS traversal maintains a rooted tree structure, and it doesn't matter if the tree has multiple roots or not. As long as there is a single rooted tree, the function will find the highest common ancestor.

However, if the input tree is a forest (i.e., a disconnected set of rooted trees), the function will not work correctly. In this case, you can modify the function to handle forests by first converting the input tree into a rooted tree (using a disjoint set data structure) and then applying the DFS-based algorithm to find the highest common ancestor within each rooted tree.

Here's an example of how to modify the function to handle forests：

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_highest_common_ancestor(root, node1, node2):
    def dfs(node, target):
        if not node:
            return None

        if node.val == target:
            return node

        left_ancestor = dfs(node.left, target)
        right_ancestor = dfs(node.right, target)

        if left_ancestor and right_ancestor:
            return node
        elif left_ancestor:
            return left_ancestor
        else:
            return right_ancestor

    def union(set1, set2):
        for item in set2:
            set1.add(item)

    def find_root(node):
        if not node:
            return None

        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return node

        if not node.left:
            return find_root(node.right)
        elif not node.right:
            return find_root(node.left)

        left_root = find_root(node.left)
        right_root = find_root(node.right)

        if left_root == right_root:
            return left_root
        else:
            union(left_root.left, right_root.left)
            union(left_root.right, right_root.right)
            return find_root(left_root)

    def build_disjoint_sets(root):
        disjoint_sets = []

        def traverse(node):
            if not node:
                return

            if not node.left and not node.right:
                disjoint_sets.append(set([node]))
            else:
                left_set = traverse(node.left)
                right_set = traverse(node.right)

                disjoint_sets.append(set(left_set) | set(right_set))

        traverse(root)
        return disjoint_sets

    root_set = build_disjoint_sets([root])
    node1_set = build_disjoint_sets([node1])
    node2_set = build_disjoint_sets([node2])

    def find_ancestor(node, target_set):
        current_set = set([node])
        while current_set != target_set:
            parent = find_root(node)
            node = parent
            current_set = disjoint_sets[disjoint_sets.index(current_set) - 1]
        return node

    ancestor1 = find_ancestor(root, node1_set)
    ancestor2 = find_ancestor(root, node2_set)

    if ancestor1 == ancestor2:
        return ancestor1
    elif ancestor1:
        return find_highest_common_ancestor(root, ancestor1, node2)
    else:
        return find_highest_common_ancestor(root, node1, ancestor2)
