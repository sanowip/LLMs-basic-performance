Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
How many integers are in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10
[answer1]:
 To solve the inequality |x + 5| < 10, we can follow these steps:

1. Write two equations: x + 5 = 10 and x + 5 = -10.
2. Solve these equations for x.
3. The solution set will be the difference between the two intervals obtained in step 2.

Step 1:
x + 5 = 10
x = 10 - 5
x = 5

Step 2:
x + 5 = -10
x = -10 - 5
x = -15

Step 3:
The solution set is the difference between the two intervals:
(-15, 5)

There are 20 integers in the solution set, counting from -14 to 4 (excluding -15 and 5):

-14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

[question2]
:What about |x + 10| < 5
[answer2]
: 对于不等式 |x + 10| < 5，我们可以按照以下步骤进行求解：

1. 写出两个方程：x + 10 = 5 和 x + 10 = -5。
2. 解这两个方程得到 x 的值。
3. 求解得到的两个区间之间的差值，得到不等式的解集。

步骤1：
x + 10 = 5
x = 5 - 10
x = -5

步骤2：
x + 10 = -5
x = -5 - 10
x = -15

步骤3：
两个区间分别为：-5 和 -15。

解集为：(-15, -5)

在这个解集中，有11个整数：

-14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4

注意，我们在计算区间时包括了边界值 -15 和 -5。
