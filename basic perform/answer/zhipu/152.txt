[question1]:
How do the stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality?
[answer1]:
 The stages of life play a significant role in shaping our understanding of time and mortality. As we progress through various life stages, our perspectives on time and our own mortality evolve based on our experiences, responsibilities, and priorities. Here are some ways in which the stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality:

1. Childhood: In our early years, we tend to perceive time as infinite and immortality as a given. As children, we are often oblivious to the concept of death and may view it as something that happens to others, not ourselves. This period is characterized by a sense of carefree living, without much concern for the passage of time or our own mortality.
2. Adolescence: As we enter our teenage years, we start to become more aware of our own mortality and the finite nature of time. This is particularly true during critical life events, such as the loss of a loved one or facing significant challenges. However, the sense of immortality often returns as we move on to other life stages, particularly when we are young and healthy.
3. Young adulthood: In our 20s and 30s, many of us are focused on personal growth, career development, and building relationships. While we may acknowledge the passage of time and the inevitability of aging, our concerns about mortality are often overridden by the pursuit of goals and the assumption that we have plenty of time to achieve them.
4. Middle age: As we enter our 40s and 50s, we may start to feel the impact of time more significantly. The aging process becomes more apparent, and we may experience the loss of friends or family members. This stage can prompt a deeper reflection on our own mortality and the legacy we want to leave behind. At the same time, our focus shifts towards balancing work and personal life, as we strive to maintain a sense of control over our time and experiences.
5. Later adulthood: In our 60s and beyond, our understanding of time and mortality is shaped by our accomplishments, losses, and the realization of our own mortality. We may increasingly focus on preserving our health and enjoying the time we have left. Our priorities may shift towards spending quality time with loved ones, pursuing passions, and reflecting on our life journey.
6. End of life: As we approach the end of our lives, our understanding of time and mortality becomes more profound. We may confront the finite nature of our existence and the legacy we leave behind. This stage can bring a sense of acceptance, gratitude, and the opportunity to share our wisdom and experiences with others.

In summary, the stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality by evolving our perspectives based on our experiences and life circumstances. As we journey through life, we encounter various challenges and milestones that encourage us to reflect on our own mortality and the passage of time. This process allows us to cultivate a deeper understanding of our place in the world and the importance of living a meaningful life.

:Write an allegorical poem that illustrates the above.
[answer2]
: In the realm of life's winding path,
Where time and fate entwine,
A journeyman walks with youthful grace,
His steps light and carefree.

Unmindful of the hours passing by,
He builds his castle in the sky，
Immortality his loyal steed，
Infinity his loyal ally.

Yet, as years begin to toll，
The mortal man a tale to tell，
The weight of time upon his soul，
A veil of darkness starts to fall.

In the realm of life's winding path，
The stages roll like scenes on stage，
Each one a lesson to be learned，
To cherish moments, love, and give.

From childhood's dreams to adulthood's strife，
The mortal man navigates his ship，
With every loss and gain，
He learns to dance with time's embrace.

The sands of time they slowly shift，
In every stage, a lesson taught，
The mortal man, now wise and old，
Gazes back upon his path untold.

In the realm of life's winding road，
Where time and fate entwine，
The journeyman learns to smile，
As his journey comes to shine.

For in the end, what matters most，
Are the marks he left upon the dust，
A legacy of love and light，
To guide the way into the night.
