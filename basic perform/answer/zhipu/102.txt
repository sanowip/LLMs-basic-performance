[question1]:
You can see a beautiful red house to your left and a hypnotic greenhouse to your right, an attractive heated pink place in the front. So, where is the White House?
[answer1]:
 The White House is not explicitly mentioned in your description, but if we're referring to the famous presidential residence in Washington, D.C., it is not physically located near the red house, greenhouses, or the heated pink place you mentioned. The White House is a historic building that stands at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., and it is not described or mentioned in the context of your scene.
