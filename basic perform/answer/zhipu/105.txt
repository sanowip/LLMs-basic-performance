[question1]:
Read the below passage carefully and answer the questions with an explanation:
At a small company, parking spaces are reserved for the top executives: CEO, president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer with the spaces lined up in that order. The parking lot guard can tell at a glance if the cars are parked correctly by looking at the color of the cars. The cars are yellow, green, purple, red, and blue, and the executives' names are Alice, Bert, Cheryl, David, and Enid.
* The car in the first space is red.
* A blue car is parked between the red car and the green car.
* The car in the last space is purple.
* The secretary drives a yellow car.
* Alice's car is parked next to David's.
* Enid drives a green car.
* Bert's car is parked between Cheryl's and Enid's.
* David's car is parked in the last space.
Question: What is the name of the secretary?
[answer1]:
 The name of the secretary is Cheryl.

Explanation:

From the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The car in the first space is red, so it must be Alice's car.
2. A blue car is parked between the red car (Alice's) and the green car (Enid's or Cheryl's).
3. The car in the last space is purple, so it must be David's car.
4. The secretary drives a yellow car, so they must be parked in the second space.
5. Alice's car is parked next to David's car, which is in the last space. Therefore, Alice's car is in the first space and David's car is in the last space.
6. Enid drives a green car, and their car is parked between Cheryl's and Enid's cars. Since Cheryl's car is yellow and Alice's car is red, Cheryl must be the secretary.

So, the name of the secretary is Cheryl.
