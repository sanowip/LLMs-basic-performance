[question2]
:Which company had the highest profit margin (profit/revenue ratio))?
[answer2]
: To calculate the profit margin (profit/revenue ratio) for each company, we can use the following formulas:

Company X: (3 billion / 30 billion) = 0.1 or 10%
Company Y: (6 billion / 60 billion) = 0.1 or 10%
Company Z: (7 billion / 20 billion) = 0.35 or 35%
Company W: (21 billion / 300 billion) = 0.07 or 7%
Company V: (25 billion / 200 billion) = 0.125 or 12.5%
Company U: (20 billion / 180 billion) = 0.111 or 11.1%

Company Z has the highest profit margin with 35%.
