Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question. Your evaluation should consider correctness and helpfulness. You will be given a reference answer and the assistant's answer. You evaluation should focus on the assistant's answer to the second question. Begin your evaluation by comparing the assistant's answer with the reference answer. Identify and correct any mistakes. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, you must rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: '[[rating]]', for example: 'Rating: [[5]]'.You don't need to repeat their questions and answers, just give reviews and ratings.The two questions need to be scored separately
[question1]:
When a number is divided by 10, the remainder is 4. What is the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4?
[answer1]:
 Let's denote the number as x. According to the given condition, we have:

x รท 10 = q1 ...... (1)

Where q1 is the quotient.

We need to find the remainder when 2x is divided by 4. Using the same logic, we can write:

2x รท 4 = q2 ...... (2)

We know that the remainder in equation (1) is 4. Now, let's solve equation (2) for q2:

2x = 4 * (q2 + r2)

Since we want to find the remainder, we can rewrite the equation as:

2x = 4q2 + 4r2

Now, if we substitute x = 4 * (q1 + 4), we get:

2(4 * (q1 + 4)) = 4q2 + 4r2

Simplifying the equation, we have:

8q1 + 32 = 4q2 + 4r2

Now, let's focus on the remainder part:

8q1 = 4q2 + 4r2 - 32

We can see that the remainder when 2x is divided by 4 is 32.

2 * (10x+4) = 20x + 8 = 4 * (5x+2) + 0

[question2]
:What about when twice the number is divided by 5?
[answer2]
: Let's denote the number as x. According to the given condition, we have:

x รท 10 = q1 ...... (1)

Where q1 is the quotient.

We need to find the remainder when 2x is divided by 5. Using the same logic, we can write:

2x รท 5 = q3 ...... (2)

We know that the remainder in equation (1) is 4. Now, let's solve equation (2) for q3:

2x = 5 * (q3 + r3)

Since we want to find the remainder, we can rewrite the equation as:

2x = 5q3 + 5r3

Now, if we substitute x = 5 * (q1 - 4/5), we get:

2(5 * (q1 - 4/5)) = 5q3 + 5r3

Simplifying the equation, we have:

10q1 - 8 = 5q3 + 5r3

Now, let's focus on the remainder part:

10q1 = 5q3 + 5r3 - 8

We can see that the remainder when 2x is divided by 5 is 8.

20x + 8 = 5 * (4x + 1) + 3
